        <h4>Instructions: </h4>
        <ol>
            <li>MAKE THE DOUGH  -- You will mix together the wet and dry ingredients separately and then add
                them to each other to form a dough. Knead it with clean hands for 1-2 minutes. It will feel quite soft and oily,
                don't worry.
            </li>
            <li>Refrigerate the dough for 20 minutes, and then knead it again for a few minutes until it feels smooth
                and soft, and has no lumps in it.
            </li>
            <li>FORM BALLS -- Now you will divide the dough into 20g balls - this recipe should make 12 gulab jamun.
                These are quite small, about the size of a large grape.
            </li>
            <li>The best way to form the balls is by gently rolling between your palms,
                applying a little bit of pressure to bind the dough. Then you alternate between
                just rolling with no pressure and applying a bit of pressure until you get a smooth ball.
                You can do it with practice!
            </li>
            <li>
                FRY THE GULAB JAMUN -- Heat ~2 inches of neutral oil in a wok. You want the oil to be medium hot,
                not hot-hot. To test, drop a small piece of dough into the oil - it should take ~5 seconds to rise
                to the surface. If it takes longer, the oil isn't hot enough. If it takes less time, it's too hot.
                Once the oil is at the right temperature, turn the heat to medium low.
            </li>
            <li>
                MAKE THE SUGAR SYRUP -- While you are frying the gulab jamun, start making the syrup in another pot or saucepan.
                Mix all the ingredients and simmer on medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Then turn off the heat.
